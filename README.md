consuming for going crowded markets. So, E-Shopping is a boon as it saves lot of time.
Online shopping is a process whereby consumers directly buy goods, services etc. from a
seller without an intermediary service over the Internet. Shoppers can visit web stores
from the comfort of their house and shop as by sitting in front of the computer. Online
