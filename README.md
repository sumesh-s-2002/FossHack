Now a days the life style of the people is different. People feel uncomfortable and time
consuming for going crowded markets. So, E-Shopping is a boon as it saves lot of time.
Online shopping is a process whereby consumers directly buy goods, services etc. from a
seller without an intermediary service over the Internet. Shoppers can visit web stores
from the comfort of their house and shop as by sitting in front of the computer. Online
stores are usually available 24 hours a day and many consumers have internet access both
at work and at home.
